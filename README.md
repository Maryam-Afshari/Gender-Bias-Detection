## Gender Bias Analysis Notebook

In this notebook, I conducted a comparative analysis of gender bias in discussions on two selected shows from `discussions.p`. The choice of these shows was made based on their relevance to the context of gender representation. After selecting the shows, I formulated a hypothesis regarding the expected gender bias in the discussions.

Next, I trained two word embeddings models, one for each show, to analyze the language used in the discussions. I compiled a list of male and female-related words considered relevant for the corpus.

Using the method outlined in the paper by Wevers, I compared the gender biases present in the discussions of both shows. Following this analysis, I interpreted the results and discussed their implications in relation to my initial hypothesis.

Ultimately, I explored whether the observed gender biases in the discussions shed light on the shows themselves or merely reflected the dynamics of the discussions surrounding them. This comprehensive approach aimed to provide insights into the portrayal and perception of gender within the contexts of the chosen shows.
